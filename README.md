# Introduction 
Run test cases for the website: https://ultimateqa.com/complicated-page.

# Getting Started
1. Ensure that Node.js is installed and if clone this repository , run npm install to get node_modules.
2. Follow the instructions to install Playwright. https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright
3. Install the Playwright Test extension for VSCode to make running test cases easier.
4. You can run your tests with the playwright test command. This will run your tests on all browsers as configured in the playwright.config file. Tests run in headless mode by default meaning no browser window will be opened while running the tests and results will be seen in the terminal. => npx playwright test
5. The HTML Reporter shows you a full report of your tests allowing you to filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests. By default, the HTML report is opened automatically if some of the tests failed, otherwise you can open it with the following command. => npx playwright show-report
